#### Integrations
##### Rapid7 Nexpose
- Added the *download_immediately* argument to the listed commands to support reports which take longer than 10 seconds to be generated:
    - ***nexpose-create-sites-report***
    - ***nexpose-create-scan-report***
    - ***nexpose-create-assets-report***
- Added the ***nexpose-get-report-status*** which returns the status of a report generation process.
- Added the ***nexpose-download-report*** which downloads a generated report.

#### Playbooks
##### New: Nexpose - Create and download a report
- Use this playbook as a sub-playbook to configure a report and download it.
This playbook implements polling by continuously running the ***nexpose-get-report-status*** command until the operation completes.
The remote action should have the following structure:

1. Initiate the operation - insert the type of the report (sites, scan, or assets) and it's additional arguments if required.
2. Poll to check if the operation completed.
3. Get the results of the operation.
